                                I'm Joshua Stringer.
                                I'm a Game Development student at University Centre South Essex in Essex, England, and an aspiring game programmer.
                                I am entering my 3rd year of the course and have learnt much in my time 
                                My passions lie in making and solving technical challenges along the way.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                From a young age, I have been interested in video games.
                                I particularly enjoyed making my own mini-games (games within games) in Minecraft.
                                Breaking down ideas and rules into independent chunks, wiring them up to be functional with redstone, and watching as it all worked together was how I spent much of my time in the game.
                                These passions informed my choices in school.
                                I took computer science to learn more about computers and how to program them and a practical course to make physical objects out of wood, plastic, and metal.
