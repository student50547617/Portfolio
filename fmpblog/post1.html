                                This post covers the idea generation for my final major project.

                                For my final major project, I have chosen to focus on programming.
                                This is in large part due to my skill and interest in this area.
                                This project will develop my skills further and be a showcase of my skills for a career in game programming.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For my first idea, I could redevelop and finish Arcane Glass, a mobile game project that I helped develop with other students in my class.
                                This game had the player collect ingredients to make craft potions with, and then sell these to the citizens of a fantasy world.
                                The result of that project was an unfinished prototype that lacked a core gameplay feature, the inventory system.
                                Whilst the project was informative and helped me develop my skills, I am not happy with the result and would like to revisit it.
                                I have been redeveloping the project over the summer and have passed the hurdle of the inventory system that stumped me in the original.
                                This project would be an easy way to complete my FMP as well as my first game.
                                I already have the original game design document as well as a large part of a prototype to work from.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For another idea, I could focus on developing my skills in multiplayer.
                                Multiplayer is a common feature in many games both in AAA and indie, so would help me in my career significantly.
                                With a focus on developing my skills in multiplayer, a fast-paced movement shooter styled after Titanfall and ULTRAKILL could be a good way to develop these skills.
                                A fast-paced game with PvP would let me learn about network delay and compensation to create fair competition between players.
                                This would involve predicting where a player would be given their movements and sending that to the other players.
                                To add a little complexity, each player would have a ranged weapon, a melee weapon, and a shield but could only hold two of these at a time.
                                The ranged weapon would deal moderate damage at range, the melee weapon would deal significant damage at a short range, and the shield would block damage.
                                Each player would also have a movement ability and a battery on which to run all of their equipment.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While I like the idea of developing my skills in multiplayer, I would also like to learn game AI.
                                This is another important area of game development, arguably more so than multiplayer as it can also be found in single-player games.
                                A cooperative dungeon crawler would allow for me to learn about multiplayer and game AI in one project.
                                It could also allow for me to learn random level generation.
                                As a twist from other dungeon crawlers, this game could have a fast pace and have objective-based gameplay.
                                The player/s will enter the dungeon with a specific goal, such as to collect a number of resources or explore a number of rooms, and can then exit the dungeon and reap a reward that carries into the next run.
                                Of course, the player/s can instead choose to venture deeper for greater rewards and greater challenge.
