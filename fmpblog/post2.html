                                This post covers the final idea for my final major project.
                            </p>

                                My final idea chosen is the cooperative multiplayer dungeon crawler.
                                This is because it allows me the greatest learning opportunities in both multiplayer and game AI.
                                It also allows me to learn random level generation.
                                All of these skills are commonly used in the games industry to make many modern games.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The concept of the game is a cooperative multiplayer dungeon crawler that can be played solo or with up to four friends.
                                The player/s enter into a randomly generated dunegon with a goal in mind, such as gather some resources, upgrade their gear, or complete a bounty.
                                At any point in a dungeon exploration, the player/s can choose to leave the dungeon and keep their current equipment.
                                Combat is fast, much like Supergiant Games' Hades, as well as the ganeral pace of the game.
                                Runs are meant to be fast and focussed.
