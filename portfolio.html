                                Arcane Glass is an original mobile game which I am in the process of developing.
                                Originally, it was created as a University project with a team of fellow students but it was not
                                completed due to the ambitious size of the project and the short time frame given in which to complete it.
                                I have taken it upon myself to remake this project and this is enabling me to use the experience to
                                grow and hone my skills in all aspects of game development.
                                Currently, it is in a pre-alpha state; many of the mechanics are yet to be added
                                and the visual elements are just placeholders.
                                Further developments will be uploaded here and I hope you will join me on the journey.

                                This project was developed for University and advanced my skills in level design,
                                modelling and sculpting, animation, and programming.
                                The task was to develop an original concept inspired by Uncharted, the Naughty Dog series
                                of adventure games.
                                I created a exploration of an island once occupied by Roman forces, now held by mercenaries in
                                search of ancient treasure.
                                A cutscene led the player through the events leading up to landing on the beach of the island,
                                including an ambush by the mercenaries and a near-death experience for the protagonist.
